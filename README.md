What the app does: 

The website shows the heat map for total payout for all prizes, giving an idea of where is the luckiest or 
not so lucky place to buylottery depending on how the user interprets the information.

Users can search for a number and the results for that number of where it most frequently appear and where the number was paid out the most,
users can filter results by Category - All Prize, 1st Prize, 2nd Prize and 3rd Prize.

Users can contribute to the heatmap by signing up an account and upload a picture to prove the results which they are to submit are real, the number 
they bought, the location which they bought and the prize payout.


Stretch goals(did not complete):
Create a 4 digit number generator with animation.
Create a filter for results duration - last 1 mth, 3mth, 1 year, etc.

Backstory:
Wanted to write an application that would help people see that playing 4D and lottery has odds that are far worse than going into a casino. As the App was developing, I realised that the problems it would create may be more than the problems it would solve hence the interest for stretch goals waned and I
no longer wanted to deploy the app to a domain. It did however gave birth to a much better idea. Project 3 is going to be a smash!
